## Custom Datesystems

You may create multiple date systems in the same game with multiple calls to `<<datesetup>>` provided that you give a unique `systemname` in the options for each system. e.g.

```html
<<set _datesetup = {
    base_time: "now",
    name: "solar"
}>>
<<datesetup _datesetup>>
```

The point of doing this, is to allow you to create your own calendars with different months, year lengths, or day names, such as a lunar calendar, a fantasy calendar, or even the French revolutionary decimal calendar (see below — with thanks to @Maliface).

### Custom Datesystem Arguments

There are many values you can pass to set up your custom calendar. Anything you don't specify as different will take the default Gregorian values. For example, if you only want to change the names of the wweekdays, you only need to pass `days`.

The following block shows the default values for the Gregorian calendar.

```js
{
    name: "default",
    min_length: 60,
    hour_length : 60,
    day_length : 24,
    days : [ "Monday", "Tuesday", "Wednesday", "Thursday", "Friday", "Saturday", "Sunday"],
    week_start: 5,
    months : [
        { name: "January"  , length: 31, season: "winter" }, 
        { name: "February" , length: 28, season: "winter", leap_century: [[400,29]], leap: [[4,29]] }, 
        { name: "March"    , length: 31, season: "spring" }, 
        { name: "April"    , length: 30, season: "spring" }, 
        { name: "May"      , length: 31, season: "spring" }, 
        { name: "June"     , length: 30, season: "summer" }, 
        { name: "July"     , length: 31, season: "summer" }, 
        { name: "August"   , length: 31, season: "summer" }, 
        { name: "September", length: 30, season: "autumn" }, 
        { name: "October"  , length: 31, season: "autumn" }, 
        { name: "November" , length: 30, season: "autumn" }, 
        { name: "December" , length: 31, season: "winter" }
      ],
      periods: { 
        y: ["year","years"], mo: ["month","months"], d: ["day","days"], h: ["hour","hours"], m: ["minute","minutes"], s: ["second","seconds"]
      }
}
```
The `name` argument defines the name of the Datesystem. This is the `system-id` argument to use in all of the date system macros, the key in `setup.datesystems` that contains the DATESYSTEM object, and the prefix of the story variable containing the system's time variable. 

e.g. if you pass `solar` as the `name` argument, the DATESYSTEM will be saved in `setup.datsystem.solar` and the time variable will be `$solar-time`.

The other system definition values are as follows:

```
    min_length:  The number of seconds in a minute
    hour_length: The number of minutes in an hour
    day_length:  The number of hours in a day
    days:        The names of each day of the week
    week_start:  The weekday on which day 1 of your calendar starts
    months:      An array of month information
    periods:     Singular and plural names for each of your time units (as used by <<dateperiod>>)
```

For `months`, the `length` value is the number of days in a non-leap year, and the `season` is the name of the season (as returnd by `[season]`).

### Leap Years

The Datesystem will run significantly faster if your calendar has no leap-days. However, if this is not possible (as it is not possible in the default Gregorian calendar) then you can specify the leap day rules as follows:

For any month that has a varying number of days:

* `leap` defines an array of rules to match based on the current year
* `leap_century` defines an array of rules to match based on the current year if it is a century year

Each rule is an array of two elements, a number, and a day length. If the year is evenly divisible by the number, then the month length will be set to the second value. If there are multiple rules, the first will match. If a month has both a `leap` and `leap_century` rule, the leap rule will *not* be applied if the year in question is a century (i.e. only the leap_century rule will apply). Any number of months may have leap rules.

**Example**
```js
{ name: "February" , length: 28, season: "winter", leap_century: [[400,29]], leap: [[4,29]] }
```
In the standard calendar, February is 28 days long. In centuries divisible by 400, or non-centuries divisible by 4, it is 29 days instead.

## Synchronising Datesystems

Although each Datesystem keeps its own time variable by default, you can easily change that by setting `DATESYSTEM.varname` to the same value. 

**Example**
```html
<<datesetup `{
    systemname: "solar",
    ...
}`>>
<<datesetup `{
    systemname: "lunar",
    ...
}`>>
<<set setup.datesystems.lunar.varname = "solar-time">>
```
